# How to run the app
1. Run a git clone to get the project locally, i.e: `git clone https://github.com/engineer-kndegwa/wiki-test.git`
2. Open index.html in your browser.

# Instructions

1. Everything should work at client side with any modern web browser. The page
should update dynamically.
2. The web page should display error when page is not found.
3. The language selector should have 10 languages, each language name written in its
own script – just like Wikipedia does – with at least 5 non-latin scripts and at least

one of them a language using right to left script. When language is changed, the
table of contents should be from the Wikipedia in that selected language.
4. The content must be fetch by Wikipedia content APIs. Refer REST API
documentation.
5. Try to avoid using javascript frameworks. Use native javascript, css, html5.
6. The page should be responsive, usable in various screen sizes.
7. Try to write the code in a readable manner with js, css in separate files.
8. Upload the source to online version control system like github or gitlab and share
the URL
9. Do not make the page too fancy, just try to get this done in 2 hours max.
